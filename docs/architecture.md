## Introduction

As far as this boilerplate uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework for building React applications, the folders are used as routes.  This means the more folders you add to your app folder, the more routes you will get. Additionally, if you create a new folder inside of another folder, you will get nested routes. To better understand these concepts, we suggest looking at the image below.

## Pages

Pages are located in the `src/app/[language]` folder. We use `[language]` directory to support internationalization with ability generate static website (`output: export`). Example [here](https://github.com/i18next/next-13-app-dir-i18next-example).
