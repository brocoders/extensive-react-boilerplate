## Motivation

Often, when we start a new project, we have to spend a lot of time on the initial setup, like authentication, implementation Private and Public routes, internationalization, etc. Also sometimes we have to sacrifice the quality of solutions during the initial setup because we need to initialize the project as soon as possible and start solving the business problems. ReactJS Boilerplate was created to solve it: we have collected in one place all basic flows and best practices focused on performance and simplicity of solutions. And even more, we have added many eslint rules that will improve your solutions. We hope that this boilerplate will help you to start your project faster and with better quality.
